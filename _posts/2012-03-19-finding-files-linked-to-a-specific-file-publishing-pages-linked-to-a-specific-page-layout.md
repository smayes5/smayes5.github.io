Ever had a need to find all of the files in a site collection that link to a specific file? A colleague of mine made an excellent find a few weeks ago and taught me this gem from the SharePoint object model. He had a need to find all publishing page layouts on a site and catalog which were being used and which weren't. Check out his post here: [SharePoint Fix: Powershell script to get SharePoint Page Layouts inventory and its usage across site collection](http://www.sharepointfix.com/2012/03/powershell-script-to-get-sharepoint.html)
