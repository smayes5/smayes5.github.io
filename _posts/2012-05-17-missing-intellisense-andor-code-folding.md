This afternoon, I was getting quite frustrated because I was working on a .master file in Visual Studio and all of the code folding and Intellisense was missing! It seems that when the .master file is opened by double-clicking it in the Solution Explorer, these items will be missing. To resolve the problem, right-click the .master file and select View Code!
