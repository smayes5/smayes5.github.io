I was in the middle of a SharePoint demo this morning, was typing some input, and all of the sudden my development server was going crazy! It turns out to be a problem I've encountered many times before. The "e" key started Windows Explorer. The "r" key started the Run dialog. The list goes on. It's so frustrating!

The first thing to check is StickyKeys, but being in the midst of a demo and quite certain I was not fiddling with my Shift key, I knew that wasn't the culprit this time.

I researched a bit and found two potential solutions:
1. CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + F12
2. CTRL + SHIFT + Windows Key

The second solution worked for me and cleared up the issue immediately! Hopefully this little tidbit will help someone else; perhaps myself at a later date!
