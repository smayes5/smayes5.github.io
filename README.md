# Steve Mayes' Personal Web Site

This repository contains the code base used to build [https://smayes.com](https://smayes.com).

## Design
The original design was sourced from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net)'s [Story template](https://html5up.net/story); to which I've made some minor modifications. The stock imagery on the site is sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

## Technologies
The web site is a static web site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my preferred IDE.

## Continuous Development Process
