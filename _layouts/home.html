			<p>I'm a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/microsoft-certified-professional.aspx">Microsoft Certified Professional</a>, a professional member of the <a href="https://acm.org">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, and a double graduate of <a href="https://case.edu">Case Western Reserve University</a>. I've had an interest in computers and technology since the early 1990s. It all started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a> and I haven't looked back since. I completed my master's thesis - <a href="https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=case1196443381">Advanced Interface for Querying Graph Data</a> - in January 2008. Since then, my professional career has spanned development, architecture, and management. My primary focus is on web-based technologies and public cloud solutions. I have over a decade of SharePoint development experience, with my more recent experience in Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and G Suite. Through my blog - <a href="{{ "/blog" | relative_url }}">Navigating the Maze</a> - I hope to give back to the community that has supported me.</p>
